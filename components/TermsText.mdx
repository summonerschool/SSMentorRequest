# Mentor Request

Welcome to the Summoner School Discord’s mentor request system!

Our mentors are here to help those who are serious about improving their gameplay and do that primarily through VOD reviews. The aim of mentoring is to provide you, the student, with general directions and learning objectives. If you meet the minimum requirements for a VOD review, a mentor will be reaching out to you through DMs. Please remember this is a free, volunteer-based service and wait times may vary depending on your rank, position, timezone, and mentor availability.

If you are new or do not meet the requirements below but are still looking for a vod review, please use the #vod-review channel for a community review (check the pins for how to get started). Any other gameplay questions can be posted in any of the educational channels.

## Minimum Requirements:

* It has been 30 days since your last fulfilled mentor request
* You have *at least* 75 total ranked solo/duo queue games played during this current split
* You have *at least* 25 ranked games played on the champion in the VOD you submit
  

## How to prepare for mentoring?

 We encourage you to consider a game that is representative of YOUR average solo queue experience. Before submitting a game, review it briefly to understand what went wrong or well. Identify major weaknesses and areas for improvement. Focus on overarching habits and general gameplay, not specific details. Ask yourself things like "Do I keep dying to jungler ganks?" or "Do my waves somehow end up in bad positions?" Come up with some questions to ask your mentor so you can get the most out of the session.

*_Note_* : Mentors may deny a review request if you do not meet the minimum requirements. Exceptions can be made for very active players at the start of the split.
