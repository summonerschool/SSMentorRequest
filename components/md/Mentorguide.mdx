## <a name="i">I. Getting started</a>

1. Say hello in `#mentor-chat`!
2. **Check the pins in `#important-mentorchat`, and request access to the [mentor request form](requests)**.
3. If you still have questions after this guide, **ping** one of the mods or senior mentors in `#mentor-chat`. Do not dm mods or senior mentors without good reason.
4. If you have any issues with the website, please contact Z (@z_the_dev) in the channel `#website-feedback`.

## <a name="ii">II. What is a trial?</a>

A trial is a two-week period to make sure potential mentors are a good fit for mentoring on our server. Trial mentors have access to the form, can complete requests, and can do almost everything else mentors can do. The main difference is that full mentors will appear on the mentor list in `#mentor-request`, and role-specific mentor roles have the “manage messages” power in their respective rooms. This is used for keeping the educational chats clean, pinning content, and removing old pins.

At the end of the trial period we will evaluate your involvement in the server—that you were being respectful in your interactions with others, engaged in the educational channels, and that you completed the minimum VOD review request requirement below. If you pass the trial period you will receive full, lane-specific mentor roles and will be added to the mentor list in `#mentor-request`.

**_VOD requirement_**: 1 request completed

## <a name="iii">III. What do mentors do?</a>

- Complete a minimum of 1 VOD review per month through [the mentor request website](requests).
  - You are able to bank up to 3 VOD reviews for the month.
  - **If you are going to be busy for the month, please let a mod or senior mentor know in `#important-mentorchat` ahead of time.**
- Engage with other members of Summoner School in the educational channels of the server in a **civil and respectful** manner.
  - You are a public figure in the server and should be a good model for our `#rules`
  - You have the ability to remove irrelevant messages from your respective role chats if necessary
- _Optional_: produce additional materials, host classroom sessions, public VOD reviews.
  - If you choose to host an educational event, please let the mod team know in advance so we can provide support and advanced notice to students/participants

## <a name="iv">IV. How to use the mentor request form</a>

- You should have access to the website with your Discord account after your application has been accepted (if not please notify the mods).
- Head over to the [request sheet](requests) and find a request you would like to take and select “In Progress” in the status column. **You are strongly encouraged to take older requests to prevent backlog.** Message the user on Discord to schedule and go through your session as you would like.
- When you have completed a request, select “Complete” in the “Status” column. Completed requests are moved to a new tab so they do not clutter the request form.
- If the student does not reply within a week, you should add a note for the reason why you are closing the request (ex: student did not respond) and mark the request as "Problem."
- If you pass the mentor trial, update [your mentor profile](profile) so you can be included in our mentors list!

## <a name="v">V. How to do a VOD review</a>

Request a VOD from your student. You may complete a VOD review through text, a recorded video, or live. Please remember you are representing the Summoner School Discord and must not be rude. Repeating your student's most significant mistakes helps highlight their biggest areas to improve and gives them some takeaways. We suggest avoiding going into overly granular detail on minor/infrequent mistakes as it may overload and discourage the student, but at the end of the day your method of teaching is up to you. If you have any questions or want more input, you can message other mentors or moderators.

- _TEXT_: Take notes, point out mistakes with timestamps in the text, then at the end (or with each timestamp), advise the mentee on how to fix the mistakes made.
- _VIDEO_: Record yourself watching the VOD (we recommend using OBS as recording software), pointing out mistakes and how to fix them. Remember, this is not commentary; it is a review! It is optional to skim through the VOD quickly on x2 speed before recording your review. This helps with identifying key areas ahead of time.
- _LIVE_: Watch the VOD and comment on key areas taking Q&A from the student. You may stream the VOD review as long as your student is okay with it.

## <a name="vi">VI. General FAQ</a>

#### What do I do if the student I contacted is no longer interested in a mentoring session or left the Discord?

This is common especially for older requests. If they are not interested anymore, mark it as “Problem.” If they are no longer in the Discord anymore, **make sure you double check with their Discord ID**. After confirming they no longer exist in the Summoner School Discord mark the request as “Problem.”

#### How do I open rofl files?

[Check this link ](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/9fc8u2/i_made_roflplayer_a_windows_tool_that_can_play/)

#### How do I record my VODs?

[OBS ](https://obsproject.com/)is software for recording and streaming. You can record and upload VODs to YouTube or stream on Twitch. You can also use [EpicPen ](https://epicpen.com/) to make markings on your screen during a VOD review.

#### Is mentoring on other platforms—potentially paid ones—fine?

Yes. However, _**in the case of paid platforms—you cannot link, advertise, or mention them in the Summoner School Discord**_. The Summoner School Discord is an environment for _free_ LoL education, and we plan on keeping it this way.

#### Can I stream my requests?

Yes, as long as the student is ok with it. If you stream a VOD review, feel free to link the stream in the corresponding lane chat or `#casual-league` if it is a general review. In order to avoid spam, do not link in more than one chat.

#### Can I link my stream in chats even for non-requests?

Yes. Mentors may stream coaching and VOD reviews—just make sure not to spam. Please be wary of the chat you are posting in as well. Educational channels should remain educational.

#### I am going to be inactive/busy/afk for X period of time. Is this okay?

Totally fine. We understand people have things like finals and vacations that take up time. However, please let one of the mods or mentor reviewers know ahead of time so we’re aware. If you are going to be busy, we won’t count that month’s inactivity against you.

#### Who are senior mentors?

Senior mentors have been active mentors for twelve months on this server.

#### Who are mentor reviewers?

Mentor reviewers help us process new mentor applications and give input for improving/fixing the mentoring system or any issues that arise.

#### Can I plug my socials etc. in mentor sessions?

Yes, as long as they do not promote paid services.

#### I can manage messages now! Does this mean I should delete rule-breaking stuff?

Generally no, unless it appears in your respective role chats. You may warn users if they are going off topic or are posting irrelevant content in educational chats. If it is super extreme (like gore or NSFW), then please do—otherwise let a moderator handle it. You can either open up a ticket or ping the `@Moderator` tag in the mentor chat. Mods are better equipped to resolve rule-breaking issues in the Discord. It also helps for moderators to catch things as they happen so they can participate in screening/be aware of them as a team.

_Any other questions? Anything we should add here? Let us know, ping a mod or mentor reviewer in `#mentor-chat!`_

Tier lists are no longer required or common to create due to the hundreds of tier list websites. You’re free to still create one if you’d like, however consulting with other mentors is highly advised to eliminate bias.

### How to make a tier list

- Remember tier lists are optional, this is just if you decided to do one here. These guidelines are not required, if you’re already familiar with making a tier list, feel free to do it how you prefer.
- These are the tier list definitions should follow:
  - Defined definitions for tiers, use S+ S S- etc
  - Rating for the entirety of high plat and higher (P2+ power pick meta list)
  - Separate rating for the entirety of mid plat and below (P3- climbing list, i.e. Annie mid S tier climbing pick)
  - Rating champions to how the average X player would perform, denoting high potential champions (rewarding when mastered, i.e. Gangplank)
- We highly encourage working in groups. This helps eliminate bias. Use `#mentor-chat` to coordinate with other mentors.
- We recommend Google Docs or Sheets because they're easy to share and edit, but you can use whatever you like.
- An important feature of tierlists that would separate it from just a random stats site is **context**. Noting _why_ certain champs are in certain spots is an important part of this process.
- Once finished, pin it in the respective lane chat.
